===== DAYTIME =====

Identify the parts of the TCP 3-way handshake by listing the frame summaries of the relevant frames. Your summaries should looks something like this:

1	0.000000000	10.0.2.15	129.6.15.28	TCP	74	43946 → 13 [SYN] Seq=0 Win=64240 Len=0 MSS=1460 SACK_PERM TSval=978431526 TSecr=0 WS=128
2	0.114533452	129.6.15.28	10.0.2.15	TCP	60	13 → 43946 [SYN, ACK] Seq=0 Ack=1 Win=65535 Len=0 MSS=1460
3	0.114671195	10.0.2.15	129.6.15.28	TCP	54	43946 → 13 [ACK] Seq=1 Ack=1 Win=64240 Len=0

This is the initial handshake between my computer and the server

What port number does the client (i.e. nc on your Kali computer) use for this interaction?

Port 13

Why does the client need a port?

So the client knows which application is using that connection to the server 

What frame contains the actual date and time? (Show the frame summary as in question 1 above.)

4	0.154944664	129.6.15.28	10.0.2.15	DAYTIME	105	DAYTIME Response

Frame 4, after the handshake

What do [SYN] and [ACK] mean?

SYN is synchronize which is the client/server asking to speak
ACK is Acknowledge which is the client/server verifying that request to speak.
 
Which entity (the nc client or the daytime server) initiated the closing of the TCP connection? How can you tell?

The server because it sent a FIN which starts the end of the connection and waits for the client to confirm the connection end.

===== HTTP ===== 

How many TCP connections were opened? How can you tell?

There were 4. By filtering SYN messages sent by the client, I see it sent 4 assuming 1 for a initial connection, the html page, and each photo.


Can you tell where my homepage (index.html) was requested? (If not, why not? If so, include frame summaries and/or other info that supports your answer.)

It was requested from here: 
30	0.202731460	10.0.2.15	172.233.221.124	HTTP	424	GET /index.html HTTP/1.1 
32	0.221095424	172.233.221.124	10.0.2.15	HTTP	667	HTTP/1.1 200 OK  (text/html)

The server 200 response contained the html for the page

Can you tell where my photograph (jeff-square-colorado.jpg) was requested? (If not, why not? If so, include frame summaries and/or other info that supports your answer.)

There were requested from here:

34	0.393142793	10.0.2.15	172.233.221.124	HTTP	463	GET /jeff-square-colorado.jpg HTTP/1.1 
307	0.730931496	172.233.221.124	10.0.2.15	HTTP	1164	HTTP/1.1 200 OK  (JPEG JFIF image)

47	0.419542961	10.0.2.15	172.233.221.124	HTTP	459	GET /misc/maisie-jeff.jpg HTTP/1.1 
470	0.872993838	172.233.221.124	10.0.2.15	HTTP	9880	HTTP/1.1 200 OK  (JPEG JFIF image)

It also requestion this icon:
473	1.268405637	10.0.2.15	172.233.221.124	HTTP	447	GET /favicon.ico HTTP/1.1 
475	1.287379919	172.233.221.124	10.0.2.15	HTTP	383	HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found  (text/html)

I didn't find this icon.

===== QUESTIONS =====

When the initial handshake is done, how does the client know what to request for?

Why is there multiple connections being made? Is a new connection needed for each image/html page or can it be done on 1 connection?
